# Pig-House-BBQ
This is the website for the Pig House BBQ business in Jackson, Tennessee, USA.

Overall Layout

-We chose the Pig House BBQ as our business for the website because I, Bryce Worley, have close relations with the owner of the business, David Clifton, and we,  the creators of the website, both enjoy eating BBQ, especially the Pig House's.

-We chose red, black, and grey as the main colors of our website because those are the main colors of the logo and the exterior of the restaurant. We chose a special shade of red for the main color of our website, which makes it different from using a traditional red color. The links in the body paragraphs are colored red, but when hovered over they change to an orange color. In the footer, however, they're the website's special red color and they turn into a regular red color when hovered over.

Header

-The navigation link of the selected page is a larger font and also colored black to well display which page you're currently viewing.

-The name of the restaurant is floated left and in a different font style to grab the viewer's attention.

Footer

-We linked the Pig House's Facebook page and phone number to clickable images which you can easily see in the footer.

-The restaurant's location and open hours are also displayed in the footer for more information, which are also links that you can click on to receive in-depth information.

Logo

-We chose the logo that we chose because it includes a sub-logo picture and sub-logo text, so that together the two form one whole logo that is very attractive and fits our website well.

Main Body Content

-A very light grey background color property was applied to all paragraphs in the main content area of each page to make them stand out from the body color, which is red. After that, a box-shadow was applied to make those paragraphs pop out from the background, along with a border radius for aesthetics. The red text in the main content paragraphs makes the words more visible when viewing each page. 

Tables

-The tables have a grey background with a black, white, and grey groove border to make it stand out from the surrounding content.

-The review table includes enough reviews so that anybody viewing the website would likely be influenced to want to go to the Pig House after seeing so many positive ones.

Responsiveness

-While working on our website, we took a mobile-first approach by putting most of our thought into making the website responsive, which we did effectively. All of the page elements display properly when the screen is downsized, which makes our website more professional.

-When the screen is downsized, all of the photos adjust properly to the width of the screen. The tables do the same as well, but the font-size in the tables decreases as the width does the same.

Favicon

-For the website's favicon, we used the picture part of the logo. This makes the icon very simple and recognizable.

Pictures

-For the implemented pictures of our website, we chose pictures of the restaurant so that anyone viewing the website can know what the restaurant looks like so that when they try to locate it, they will know what it looks like and will be able to find it easily.

-The pictures of the menu items on the menu page shows anyone viewing our website samples of what you can order at our restaurant. These pictures also help grab the viewer's attention and will influence them to come eat at our restaurant.

-We have an older picture of the Pig House BBQ restaurant displayed on the about page so that the viewer can look into the restaurant's past and see what the restaurant looked like when it was first opened. In this way, we can show the Pig House's history which is very important to what it is today.

Contact Information

-We have all of the contact information listed on the contact page, which includes the Pig House's email, phone number, and Facebook page links. This makes it easier for any viewer to locate all of the contact information at once. We also have the Facebook page and phone number links in the footer displayed as easy-to-see pictures which you can click on in order to follow the link.

Contact Form

-We have included a form on the contact page which allows the viewer of the website to have a way to contact the Pig House via email more easily, rather than having to go through all of the necessary steps to send an email manually.
